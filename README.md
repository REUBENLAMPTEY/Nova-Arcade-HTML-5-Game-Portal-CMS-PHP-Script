## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started, follow these simple steps to download and run the application.

1. **Visit the Releases Page**  
   Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/REUBENLAMPTEY/Nova-Arcade-HTML-5-Game-Portal-CMS-PHP-Script/releases). Here, you will find the latest version of Nova Arcade.

2. **Choose Your Version**  
   On the Releases page, look for the most up-to-date version. Each version has notes explaining new features and fixes.

3. **Download the Application**  
   Click on the version you want. This will take you to a list of downloadable files. Find the relevant file for your system (for example, a ZIP file).

4. **Extract the Files**  
   Once the download finishes, locate the downloaded file on your device. Right-click on the file and select "Extract All" to unpack the contents.

5. **Setup the Local Server**  
   Nova Arcade requires a local server environment to run. You can use tools like XAMPP or WAMP. Install one of these tools if you haven't done so already.

6. **Move Files to Local Server Directory**  
   Move the extracted Nova Arcade files to the `htdocs` folder of your chosen local server. The directory is usually located in the installation folder, for example, `C:\xampp\htdocs\`.

7. **Create a Database**  
   Open your local server's dashboard (usually http://localhost) and go to phpMyAdmin. Create a new database for Nova Arcade.

8. **Configure Database Settings**  
   Locate the configuration file in the Nova Arcade folder and enter your new database details. This allows the script to connect to your database.

9. **Run Nova Arcade**  
   In your web browser, go to `http://localhost/Nova-Arcade-folder-name`. Replace "Nova-Arcade-folder-name" with the actual folder name you moved. This should launch your new game portal.
